# Google-stock-price-analysis-and-Prediction
This paper presents a data product for stock price analysis and prediction using machine learning techniques. The goal of the data product is to analyze historical stock market data of Google and forecast its future prices. The paper outlines the problem statement, key requirements for the data product, and the choice of forecasting models, including Prophet and LSTM. The data collection process involves obtaining reliable and up-to-date historical stock market data of Google. Data preprocessing and cleaning techniques are applied to handle missing values and outliers. Time series analysis is performed to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns in the data. The forecasting models are trained and evaluated using performance metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The data product provides visualizations to display historical stock prices, trends, and forecasted values, making it user-friendly for investors and businesses in the stock market domain. The success of the data product is measured based on the accuracy of the forecasting models and positive user feedback about its usability and effectiveness.
